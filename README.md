## Features

1. Search functionality: Users can search for specific locations using a variety of filters including location, date range, number of guests, price range and room type.
2. Calendar date selection: By selecting the dates on the calendar, users can see the availability of listings in the area and also set preferences for their travel dates.
3. Filter search: Users can further narrow down their search by applying additional filters such as price range, number of bedrooms, amenities, etc.
4. User authentication: Users can create an account with their email address or use their Google/Facebook credentials in order to perform actions like booking a listing, write a review or access their personal dashboard.
5. Booking: Upon finding a suitable listing, users can book the accommodation by filling out relevant information such as number of guests, duration of stay, contact info, payment method, etc.
6. Dashboard: Registered users can check their booking history, update their profile information, write and view reviews of listings, schedule reminders for upcoming trips and manage their payment methods.
7. Responsive design: The website was optimized to be viewed on multiple devices of different sizes.
